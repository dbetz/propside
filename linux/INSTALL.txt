SimpleIDE Linux Installation

INTRODUCTION

The Parallax SimpleIDE is designed for building Propeller C programs.
SimpleIDE is distributed for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Linux Packaging:

Linux packages are offered in two ways: 
1. Debian binary .deb package (Debian, Mint, Ubuntu)
  This package should be used by current libqtgui(N) and libqtcore(N) users.
  Fedora, Suse, and other packages are not available yet.
2. Stand-alone package (Linux distribution type in package name).
  This package should be used in systems that do not have any Qt libraries.

In the instruction below SimpleIDE-packagename.bz2 refers to the package
such as SimpleIDE-1-0-i686-linux.bz2. SimpleIDE-version refers to the
SimpleIDE version such as SimpleIDE-1-0.

Please note the $ sign is a standard symbol for a command prompt in Linux.
If you see "$ command", it means enter command in your command terminal window.

INSTALLATION

Installation requires using the Linux Terminal with root access.
Prefix commands below with sudo if necessary (sudo is recommended, or login as root).

INSTALL for Debian binary .deb only (should work with Debian, Mint, Ubuntu)

  Installation requires using the Linux Terminal with root access.
  Prefix commands below with sudo if necessary (sudo is recommended, or login as root).

  1. Download the appropriate .deb package (i386 for 32 bit systems, or amd64 for 64 bit systems)
  2. Set packagename if you like for example$ export PACKAGENAME=simpleide-1.0-i386.deb
  3. Go to the download directory and type$ dpkg -i $PACKAGENAME
  4. Enter$ apt-get install -f
  5. Answer Y and enter as required to install dependencies. Take a short break.
  6. Return to the user account (don't use sudo) and enter simpleide from the terminal.

  To remove the package, use$ apt-get remove simpleide

INSTALL for Stand-alone package (only)

  1. Unpack SimpleIDE with the linux distribution's archive tool or$
     tar -xjf SimpleIDE-packagename.bz2

  2. Change directory$ cd SimpleIDE-version.

  3. Setup as root with$ sudo ./setup.sh (or root$ ./setup.sh)
   a. The setup.sh can also remove SimpleIDE with$ sudo ./setup.sh remove
   b. Note that setup.sh will add /usr/bin/simpleide and /opt/simpleide.

  4. SimpleIDE workspace:
   a. Spin library files are saved in /opt/simpleide/spin
   b. Demos or other files to be edited must be copied from there to a p

  5. For the installer will remove this property file:
   ~/.config/ParallaxInc/SimpleIDE.conf file.

  6. Users may add a shortcut to /usr/bin/simpleide on the desktop for easy access.

RUN

  1. From any directory, run with the command $ simpleide
   a. Do not use$ ./simpleide; it will not work.
   b. Typing$ simpleide starts /usr/bin/simpleide which properly sets the environment.
   c. Alternatively use$ simpleide & (makes the program run in the background).

  2. The SimpleIDE program should start with: ~Documents/Welcome.spin
