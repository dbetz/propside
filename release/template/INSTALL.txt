SimpleIDE Linux Installation

The Simple IDE is designed for building Propeller-GCC programs.
SimpleIDE is distributed for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Linux Packaging:

Linux packages are primitive at the moment and will be changed to use the
typical packager tools for the platform. The current package includes a
setup script and supporting shared libraries. If you are items missing from
the system required by SimpleIDE you can use the ldd tool to find out what
you need, I.E. $ ldd SimpleIDE

The general Linux install procedure is this:

This Linux SimpleIDE package may contain only the SimpleIDE.
If package > 60MB, it contains Propeller-GCC, and step 1 below can be skipped.
If /opt/parallax already exists, step 1 below can be skipped.

Debian packages are known to work on Ubuntu.

In the instruction below SimpleIDE-packagename.bz2 refers to the package
such as SimpleIDE-0-6-2-i686-linux.bz2. SimpleIDE-version refers to the
SimpleIDE version such as SimpleIDE-0-6-2.

1. Optionally download and install Propeller-GCC to /opt/parallax
2. Unpack SimpleIDE with $ tar -xjf SimpleIDE-packagename.bz2
3. Change directory $ cd SimpleIDE-version.
4. Setup with $ sudo ./setup.sh $USER (or use root $ ./setup.sh username)
5. Run with $ ./simpleide
6. In SimpleIDE Compiler Properties:
 a. Choose the compiler from /opt/parallax/bin
 b. Choose the loader path as /opt/parallax/propeller-load
 c. Choose a workspace for new projects.
