SimpleIDE Linux Installation

The Simple IDE is designed for building Propeller-GCC programs.
SimpleIDE is distributed for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

Linux Packaging:

Linux packages are primitive at the moment and will be changed to use the
typical packager tools for the platform. The current package includes a
setup script and supporting shared libraries. If you are items missing from
the system required by SimpleIDE you can use the ldd tool to find out what
you need, I.E. $ ldd SimpleIDE

The general Linux install procedure is this:

This Linux SimpleIDE package may contain only the SimpleIDE.
If package > 60MB, it contains Propeller-GCC, and step 1 below can be skipped.
If /opt/parallax already exists, step 1 below can be skipped.

Debian packages are known to work on Ubuntu.

In the instruction below SimpleIDE-packagename.bz2 refers to the package
such as SimpleIDE-0-6-2-i686-linux.bz2. SimpleIDE-version refers to the
SimpleIDE version such as SimpleIDE-0-6-2.

INSTALL

1. Unpack SimpleIDE with $ tar -xjf SimpleIDE-packagename.bz2
2. Change directory $ cd SimpleIDE-version.
3. Setup with $ sudo ./setup.sh $USER (or use root $ ./setup.sh username)
   (Note that setup.sh will add /usr/bin/simpleide, /opt/parallax, and /opt/simpleide.)
4. SimpleIDE workspace:
 a. Remove ~/Documents/SimpleIDE to get a new copy of the workspace.
 b. On first run simpleide will install ~/Documents/SimpleIDE files.
5. Previous users should remove the ~/.config/ParallaxInc/SimpleIDE.conf file.

RUN

1. From any directory, run with the command $ simpleide
   (Do not use "./simpleide". The one installed in /usr/bin/simpleide should work.)
   (The $ sign is a standard symbol for a command prompt in Linux.)
2. The SimpleIDE Compiler Properties should have:
 a. Compiler /opt/parallax/bin
 b. Loader path /opt/parallax/propeller-load
 c. Workspace ~/Documents/SimpleIDE
3. The SimpleIDE program should start with the Welcome.c demo
